<h1>LeagueDex</h1>
<p>In the last few years, the increase in users on Instagram has dictated an expansion of the tools that the social network in question offers us. One of these is the implementation of augmented reality filters.
The Instagram page LeagueDex is something new that will allow the summoners to interact with their favorite champions in an augmented reality context, a solution that is constantly progressing within the gaming and multimedia entertainment market. The user will have the opportunity to choose their favorite character from the rich database of filters that will find on the page, deciding whether or not to create a funny and singular story or photo alongside their favorite character. The page in question will allow the user not only to select the base skin of the champion but also the different customizations made available by the same filter. After the selection, by capturing a flat surface with a simple tap on the screen, the user will position the character within his stories or photos; After an initial selection phase, the user can then determine their position, size and rotation through the various gestures. Among other things, you will have the opportunity, where allowed, to be able to change the skin of the champion thanks to a second tap on it.</p>
<p>No registration or installation needed, just go to your instagram profile @LeagueDex and follow us to see all the database of champions</p>
